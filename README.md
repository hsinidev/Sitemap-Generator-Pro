## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a client-side application and requires no build process to run.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hsinidev/sitemap-generator-pro.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd sitemap-generator-pro
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
    For the best experience, use a local server extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code.

## ✍️ How It Works

This is a **placeholder project**, meaning the front-end is fully functional for collecting user input and displaying a simulated output. The XML generation is handled entirely on the client-side using pure TypeScript string manipulation in `lib/SitemapBuilder.ts`. There is no backend connection. The purpose is to showcase a high-quality user interface and front-end architecture for such a tool.
